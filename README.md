# TuneBox
Throughout my coding education, I built a music web application utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was aimed at highlighting my front-end web development abilities. The application is responsive and intuitive, allowing users to seamlessly play music. I used HTML and CSS for interface design and styling, while JavaScript handled user interactions like play, pause, and track skipping.
